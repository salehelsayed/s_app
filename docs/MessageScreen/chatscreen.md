**Dear Developer,**

Since the final design should integrate seamlessly with the app’s existing color theme rather than using a pure black background, please follow these updated guidelines:

1. **Consistent Theming:**  
   - Identify the primary, secondary, and background colors already used in the application’s theme.
   - Use the app’s standard background color as the base for this message screen. If the theme generally uses a dark or tinted background, apply that color here. Otherwise, use the designated base background color from the style guide.
   - Ensure that any text or icons remain sufficiently visible against this background. If the theme background is lighter, switch text and icon colors to darker shades as needed.

2. **Search Bar Integration:**
   - At the top, include a search bar that matches the rest of the app’s styling:
     - If your theme uses a card or panel style, replicate that styling for the search bar background.
     - If your theme uses a subtle elevation or a distinct accent line, incorporate these elements.
   - Keep the placeholder text and search icon colors consistent with other similar input fields in your app.

3. **Message List Styling:**
   - The list of conversations should blend into the chosen theme. Use the same font, text color, and elevation or divider styles that the app uses elsewhere.
   - If your app normally uses a specific card component or a gradient background, apply the same approach to these message list items.
   - The username and last message preview text colors should follow the typographic guidelines your app uses for headings and subheadings. For example, if headings are typically a darker version of the primary color, apply that to the username. If secondary text usually appears in a lighter shade of the primary text color, use that for timestamps and message previews.

4. **Avatars and Icons:**
   - The profile avatar should maintain the same shape, border, or elevation treatments used across other parts of the app. If avatars elsewhere have a subtle border or a drop shadow, do the same here.
   - Any icons, such as the search icon, should match the iconography style and color used in other screens.

5. **Dividers and Spacing:**
   - If your app uses a particular style of dividers (e.g., thin lines in a lighter or darker shade of the background), incorporate the same divider lines between conversation items.
   - Match the vertical and horizontal padding to the standard spacings in your UI design system. For instance, if the app specifies 8px padding inside lists, use the same spacing here.

6. **State Indications and Interactions:**
   - If your app uses a particular highlight color for pressed or selected states, apply it when a conversation row is tapped. This helps maintain visual consistency and predictable interactions.
   - If unread messages are indicated elsewhere with a particular badge or bolded text, use the same pattern here.

7. **Testing and Iteration:**
   - Once implemented, compare the message screen to other existing screens and confirm that colors, fonts, spacings, and iconography are consistent.
   - Adjust the background shade, text brightness, or spacing if something seems out of place or less readable.

By applying these instructions, you will create a message screen that feels like a natural extension of your app’s existing theme and design language, rather than standing out as a separate or mismatched component.
