**Dear Developer,**

Currently, you have a message overview screen with a search bar at the top and a list of conversations below. Each conversation shows the contact name, a snippet of the last message, and a timestamp. What we need now is to enable navigation to a chat window once the user taps on a conversation. Here’s what you should do:

1. **On Conversation Tap:**
   - Implement a `ListTile` or similar clickable widget for each conversation item.  
   - When the user selects a conversation, navigate to a dedicated chat screen for that particular contact.
   - Pass along any necessary data—such as the contact’s name, profile image, and unique identifier—so the chat screen knows which conversation to display.

2. **Chat Window Layout (Signal-Style):**
   The chat window should be inspired by Signal’s clean and minimalistic design. Key features include:

   - **Header Area:**
     - Display the contact’s name or nickname at the top, using the same typography style as your app’s headings.
     - Include a back arrow or navigation icon on the left so users can return to the conversation list.
     - If your theme includes profile images, show a small circular avatar of the contact in the top bar, aligned either to the left or just before the contact’s name.
     - Keep the header’s background and text colors consistent with the rest of your theme. Avoid pure black if not part of the theme. Use a subtle tinted background or your standard app primary color, depending on your existing style guide.

   - **Message List:**
     - Present messages in a scrolling list that automatically scrolls to the bottom as new messages appear.
     - Align outgoing messages (sent by the user) to the right and use a distinct background color (e.g., a lighter bubble) to differentiate them.
     - Align incoming messages (received from the contact) to the left and use another subtle background color for those bubbles.
     - Use rounded corners on message bubbles, consistent with Signal’s style and your app’s overall design language.
     - Keep timestamps subtle and well-spaced—either placing them underneath each message bubble or grouping them by conversation time.
     - If message status indicators (e.g., sent, delivered, read) are part of your app, place them near outgoing messages, similar to how Signal places small checkmarks.

   - **Input Bar:**
     - At the bottom of the screen, implement a text input field for composing messages.
     - Include an icon for attaching media (paperclip or similar) to the left and a send icon (paper plane or arrow) to the right.
     - Maintain padding and spacing so that the input field feels roomy and easy to interact with.
     - The input bar background can be slightly elevated or use a lighter shade of the background color to differentiate it from the message list above, mimicking Signal’s clean layering.

   - **Colors & Typography:**
     - Use your app’s standard color palette. If you have a dark theme, ensure text and bubble colors have sufficient contrast. If your theme is light, ensure that the bubble and background colors are subtle and complementary.
     - Follow Signal’s approach where each element is understated but clear. Use minimal borders and rely on color contrasts, text size, and spacing to create a structured, easily readable layout.
     - Make sure fonts match the rest of your app—no need to exactly match Signal’s font, but keep it clean and modern.

3. **Interactivity & Smooth Navigation:**
   - Ensure that tapping on a conversation smoothly transitions to the chat screen (e.g., with a standard page transition animation).
   - The back arrow in the chat screen’s top bar should return the user to the message overview screen without losing their position in the list.
   - If you’re using state management (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Bloc), ensure the chat loads the correct conversation history. If messages are fetched from a server, display a loading indicator while fetching.

4. **Multiple Messages & Testing:**
   - Implement a few placeholder messages (outgoing and incoming) to test the layout before integrating real data.
   - Test scrolling long conversation histories to ensure performance remains smooth.
   - Confirm that message bubbles wrap text correctly, handle emojis, and properly display timestamps.

By following these instructions, when the user taps a conversation on the overview screen, they’ll be taken to a Signal-inspired chat window. This will offer a clean, familiar, and user-friendly messaging experience while maintaining the visual consistency of your existing theme.
