**Dear Developer,**

The `TabBar` is designed to fit snugly into the `AppBar` layout, and simply wrapping it in a `Container` with an explicit height often doesn’t visibly change its height. To reliably control the height of the `TabBar`, you should use the `AppBar`’s `bottom` property along with a `PreferredSize` widget.

**Here’s what to do:**

1. Move the `TabBar` from the `title` row into the `bottom` property of the `AppBar`.
2. Wrap the `TabBar` with a `PreferredSize` widget and specify the desired height in `Size.fromHeight(...)`.
3. This approach ensures that the `AppBar` layout logic respects the given height, making the `TabBar` visibly taller.

**Example:**

```dart
appBar: AppBar(
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
  elevation: 0,
  automaticallyImplyLeading: false,
  title: Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.only(left: 16.0),
    child: CircleAvatar(
      backgroundColor: Colors.grey,
      child: Icon(Icons.person, color: Colors.white),
    ),
  ),
  centerTitle: false,
  bottom: PreferredSize(
    preferredSize: const Size.fromHeight(60.0), // Adjust as needed
    child: const TabBar(
      labelColor: Colors.black,
      unselectedLabelColor: Colors.grey,
      indicatorColor: Colors.black,
      tabs: [
        Tab(text: 'For you'),
        Tab(text: 'Following'),
      ],
    ),
  ),
),
```

**Why This Works:**

- Placing the `TabBar` in the `AppBar`’s `bottom` property makes the `AppBar` responsible for measuring and laying it out.  
- `PreferredSize` communicates your desired height to the `AppBar`, ensuring that the `TabBar`’s height visibly changes on the screen.  
- Adjust the `Size.fromHeight(...)` value until you achieve the desired height.

By following this approach, you’ll have direct and reliable control over the `TabBar` height.
