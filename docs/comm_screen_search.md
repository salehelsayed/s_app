**Dear Developer,**

Please add a search icon in the top section of the screen (where the navigation elements currently are). When the user taps on this icon, it should navigate to the search page layout shown in the attached reference, maintaining the application’s existing theme colors and not introducing a pure black background.

**Key Points:**

1. **Search Icon Placement:**  
   - Place the search icon (`Icons.search` or your custom icon) in the same top bar as the “My Communities” and “Explore” tabs.
   - Align and space it consistently with the other icons and UI elements in the top bar.
   
2. **Navigation to Search Page:**  
   - On tap of the search icon, present the search page. This page should:
     - Display a search bar at the top that uses the same theming as the rest of the app. If your app uses a light or tinted background, ensure the search bar matches that style.
     - Show filter chips (like “Sports,” “Technology,” “Art,” “Entertainment”) below the search bar.
     - Render the community list below the filters, following the existing typography, spacing, and background colors defined by the app’s design guidelines.

3. **Consistent Theming (No Pure Black):**  
   - If your app uses a dark theme, use the standard dark background already established in your application’s theme rather than pure black.
   - If your app uses a light or tinted background, apply that same background color here.
   - Ensure the text and icons remain legible with appropriate contrast against this background.

4. **Search Interaction:**
   - The search field at the top should follow the same styles as other input fields in your app, including placeholder text color, corner radius, and icon styling.
   - Typing in the search field should filter the displayed communities in real-time, if that’s part of your intended functionality.

5. **Testing & Refinement:**
   - After implementation, verify that the search icon is clearly visible and easy to tap.
   - Ensure that upon tapping the search icon, the transition to the search page is smooth and consistent with other navigational patterns in the app.
   - Check that the filters and community list render correctly, with proper spacing and alignment, and that they adapt to different screen sizes without truncation or overlap.

By following these instructions, you will have a top search icon that, when tapped, navigates to the new search page. This page will seamlessly match the rest of the app’s color theme and design style, providing a cohesive and intuitive user experience.
